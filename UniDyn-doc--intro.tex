% \cite{Untidt2002jan} = Closed solution to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff problem: Exact 
%	effective Hamiltonian theory for analysis of nuclear-magnetic-resonance experiments
%
%	For spins, the matrices appearing in the propagator are finite and the propagator can be
%   expanded using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.  Products of propagators can be combined using
%   the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff, which for small numbers of spins also contains only a finite 
%   number of terms.   Goal: an effective Hamiltonian.

%
% \cite{Nguyen1998dec} = Symbolic calculations of unitary transformations in quantum dynamics
%
%	Unitary transformations are represented by a truncated, finite series of nested commutators 
%	involving the generator.  Nguyen et al. described a procedure for resumming the subseries
%   to give a closed-form expression; we have tried this approach and find it to fail when the
%   arguments of the sines, cosines, and exponentials involve non-simple expressions such as
%   fractions.  Beskrovnyi1 was interested in a few coupled multiple oscillators, field modes. 
%   Same approach, but with multiple modes.
