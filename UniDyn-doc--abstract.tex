We have developed a \emph{Mathematica} algorithm for symbolically calculating the unitary transformations of quantum-mechanical operators.  The algorithm obtains closed-form analytical results, does not rely on a matrix representation of operators, and is applicable to both bounded systems like coupled spins and unbounded systems like harmonic oscillators.  The rotations are ``self derived'' from the operators' underlying commutation relations.  Example calculations are presented involving magnetic resonance and quantum optics.
