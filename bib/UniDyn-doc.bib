This is relatively easy to calculate for a single spin, but coupled systems present real challenges. We have used Maple, a computer algebra program to calculate one- and two-spin symbolically, and larger systems numerically. The one-spin calculations illustrate and validate the methods and show how the steady-state free precession method converges to continuous wave NMR. For two-spin systems, we have derived a general formula for the creation of double-quantum signals as a function of irradiation strength, coupling constant, and chemical shift difference. The calculations on three-spin and larger systems reproduce and extend previously published results. In this paper, we have shown that the approach works well for systems in literature. However, the formalism is general and can be extended to more complex spin systems and pulses sequences.},

We present a new method to decompose density matrices via so-called standard matrices, consider the important case of an isotropic two-qudit state and decompose it according to each basis. In the case of qutrits we show a representation of an entanglement witness in terms of expectation values of spin-1 measurements, which is appropriate for an experimental realization.},

External routines: Lapack (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) Nature of problem: Decompose any given unitary operation into a quantum circuit with only elementary quantum logic gates. Solution method: This package decomposes an arbitrary unitary matrix, by applying the CSD algorithm recursively, into a series of block-diagonal matrices, which can then be readily associated with elementary quantum gates to form a quantum circuit. Restrictions: The only limitation is imposed by the available memory on the user’s computer. Additional comments: This package is applicable for any arbitrary unitary matrices, both real and complex. If the unitary matrix is real, its corresponding quantum circuit is much simpler, with only half the number of quantum gates in comparison with complex matrices of the same size. Running time: Memory and CPU time requirements depend critically on the size of the unitary matrix to be decomposed. Run-time is dominated by the recursive CSD.

We show the advantages of the method in comparison with standard approaches, especially when dealing with the exponential of low-dimensional matrices. In contrast to other approaches that require, e.g., solving differential equations, the present method only requires the construction of the inverse of the Vandermonde matrix. We show the advantages of the method by applying it to different cases, mostly restricting the calculational effort to the handling of two-by-two matrices.},

  abstract = {A computer algebra tool for describing the Liouville-space quantum evolution of nuclear 1/2-spins is introduced and implemented within a computational framework named Spin Dynamics by Computer Algebra System (SD-CAS). A distinctive feature compared with numerical and previous computer algebra approaches to solving spin dynamics problems results from the fact that no matrix representation for spin operators is used in SD-CAS, which determines a full symbolic character to the performed computations. Spin correlations are stored in SD-CAS as four-entry nested lists of which size increases linearly with the number of spins into the system and are easily mapped into analytical expressions in terms of spin operator products. For the so defined SD-CAS spin correlations a set of specialized functions and procedures is introduced that are essential for implementing basic spin algebra operations, such as the spin operator products, commutators, and scalar products. They provide results in an abstract algebraic form: specific procedures to quantitatively evaluate such symbolic expressions with respect to the involved spin interaction parameters and experimental conditions are also discussed. Although the main focus in the present work is on laying the foundation for spin dynamics symbolic computation in NMR based on a non-matrix formalism, practical aspects are also considered throughout the theoretical development process. In particular, specific SD-CAS routines have been implemented using the YACAS computer algebra package (http://yacas.sourceforge.net), and their functionality was demonstrated on a few illustrative examples.},

The algorithm easily deals with fully rhombic interaction tensors, and is able, with little if any modification, to treat a large variety of the relaxation mechanisms encountered in NMR, EPR, and spin dynamics in general.},

If the total wave function is approximated by such a projection of a single determinant, the description of the system may be reduced to the ordinary Hartree-Fock scheme treating this determinant, if the original Hamiltonian is replaced by a complete Hamiltonian Ωop=O†HopO containing also many-particle interactions. This approach corresponds to a "fixed" configurational interaction, but the scheme has preserved the physical simplicity and visuality of the Hartree-Fock approximation. The idea of "doubly filled" orbitals is abandoned, and the orbitals associated with different spins will automatically try to arrange themselves in such a way that particles having antiparallel spins will tend to avoid each other due to their mutual repulsion.},

In the present study, we introduce simple alternant quotient expressions for the coefficients of the polynomial matrix expansion of these entangled operators. These expressions facilitate an extension of our previous closed solution to the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff problem for SU(N) systems from N⩽4 to any N, and thereby the potential application of EEHT to more complex NMR spin systems. Similarity matrix transformations of the EEHT expansion are used to develop alternant quotient expressions, which are fully general and prove useful for evaluation of any smooth matrix function. The general applicability of these expressions is demonstrated by several examples with relevance for NMR spectroscopy. The specific form of the alternant quotients is also used to demonstrate the fundamentally important equivalence of Sylvester’s theorem (also known as the spectral theorem) and the EEHT expansion.},

The capability of our so-called exact effective Hamiltonian theory for analytical and numerical analysis is demonstrated by evaluation of multiple-pulse methods within liquid- and solid-state nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopy.

  abstract = {In many-particle problems involving interacting fermions or bosons, the most natural language for expressing the Hamiltonian, the observables, and the basis states is the language of the second-quantization operators. It thus appears advantageous to write numerical computer codes which allow the user to define the problem and the quantities of interest directly in terms of operator strings, rather than in some low-level programming language. Here I describe a Mathematica package which provides a flexible framework for performing the required translations between several different representations of operator expressions: condensed notation using pure ASCII character strings, traditional notation (“pretty printing”), internal Mathematica representation using nested lists (used for automatic symbolic manipulations), and various higher-level (“macro”) expressions. The package consists of a collection of transformation rules that define the algebra of operators and a comprehensive library of utility functions. While the emphasis is given on the problems from solid-state and atomic physics, the package can be easily adapted to any given problem involving non-commuting operators. It can be used for educational and demonstration purposes, but also for direct calculations of problems of moderate size.
