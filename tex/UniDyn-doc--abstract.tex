We have developed \emph{Mathematica} algorithms for symbolically calculating unitary transformations of quantum-mechanical operators.  These algorithms obtain closed-form analytical results, do not rely on a matrix representation of operators, and are applicable to both bounded systems like coupled spins and unbounded systems like harmonic oscillators.  The unitary transformations are \emph{self derived} from the operators' underlying commutation relations and can be carried out in a \emph{basis free} way.  Example calculations are presented involving magnetic resonance and quantum optics.
